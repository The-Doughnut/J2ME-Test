# J2ME-Test

This is a test for me to see how J2ME works and stuff. You can poke around if you want.

# UPDATE (Feb 21 2021)
It has the lyrics of three songs: Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, Hardware Store by Weird Al, and Numa Numa (Dragostea Din Tei) by O-Zone. I tried adding more songs but it gave me errors and I couldn't figure out why so that's something I have to work on.
